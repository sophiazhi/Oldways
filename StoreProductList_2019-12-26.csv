106,POS_MedPyr,Mediterranean Diet Pyramid Poster,"This Mediterranean Diet Pyramid Poster beautifully and invitingly depicts the healthy foods and drinks of the Mediterranean diet.  In 1993 Oldways created the Mediterranean Diet Pyramid – in partnership with the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) – as a healthier alternative to the USDA’s original food pyramid. Today, the Mediterranean Diet is more popular than ever, with new research every month documenting its beneﬁts, and chefs and home cooks alike embracing Mediterranean ingredients and ﬂavors. The Mediterranean Diet Pyramid includes: Core foods to enjoy every day: whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans, herbs, spices, nuts and healthy fats such as olive oil. Twice weekly servings of ﬁsh and seafood. Moderate portions of dairy foods, eggs, and occasional poultry. Infrequent servings of red meats and sweets. An emphasis on the importance of physical activity and enjoying healthy meals with friends and family. The Mediterranean Diet Pyramid color poster is 24"" x 36"" in size, and printed on glossy poster stock. Illustrated by George Middleton. The Pyramid is also available as magnets, cards, and tear-pads for inspiration and reminders of the best foods to select for good health. ____________________________ About the Mediterranean Diet  The Mediterranean Diet features a wide variety of plant-based food including vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, legumes, beans, herbs, spices, and olive oil. Foods eaten in moderation include fish, seafood, poultry, eggs, and dairy. Desserts and red meat are saved for special occasions.  Research has linked the Mediterranean Diet to many health benefits such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. In 2019, U.S. News and World Report ranked the Mediterranean Diet as the #1 Best Diet Overall, Best Diabetes Diet, Best Diet for Healthy Eating, Best Heart-Healthy Diet, Best Plant-Based Diet, and Easiest Diet to Follow. ____________________________ Bulk Orders, Co-branding & Promotions Discounts are available for purchases of 10 or more, and appear automatically during the checkout process.
